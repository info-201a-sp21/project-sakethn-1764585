  Bitcoin was a pioneer in making digital currency \"Legimate\" and has one
  of the most loyal user bases of any new coin. With its rich history and
  first mover's advantage, it is only natural that it is still leading.

    antagonizes the US dollar, it is shocking that Tether, a US based crypto, is
    the most traded coin. It seems that the volitlity of cryptocurrencies is
    something that even its loyal users can't escape and sometimes something
